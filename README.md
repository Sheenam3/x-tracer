# x-tracer

In the era of kubernetes and containerization, there is a need to scale applications and understand its working inside a pod or a container. Kubernetes provision two metric pipelines to evaluate the applications performance and where bottlenecks can be erased for further enhancement:

1. Resource Metric Pipeline
According to the kubernetes documentation, a metric-server(need to deploy seprately), which discovers all the nodes and calculate its CPU and memory usage. Kubelet fetches individual container usage statistics in run time using ```kubectl top``` utility.

2. Full Metrics Pipeline<
  Like Prometheus, tool for event monitoring and alerting when crash occurs, by checking memory checks continuously. In short, it monitors linux/window servers, apache server, single application, and services with units like cpu status, memory usage, requests counts etc.


Here we are introducing a tool by ITRI named x-tracer , which traces every process log inside a pod and stream the logs to the x-tracer server in real time.

x-tracer includes 7 ebp tools(BCC),probes to trace the process events:

1. Tcp connections: closed, active, established, life
2. Block device I/O 
3. New executed processes
4. Cache kernel function calls

<h2>Basic Architecture/Flow of x-tracer:</h2>

<b>x-tracer flow:</b>
1. x-tracer server is deployed on the master node
2. x-agent client deploys on the worker node(in which our target pod is running)
3. x-agent creation triggers a go module named ```probeparser```, which executes 7 different probes(ebpf tools)
4. 7 probes traces the logs of the target_pod's processes using namespace ID(as every process PID in container belongs to the same namespace ID) 
5. These generated logs from the probes are channelized to the x-tracer server in real time


<b>The following logs are streamed at the x-tracer server: </b>
